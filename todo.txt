IMPLEMENTED
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
001) Put json info into object. //pokemonObject is populated with the getPokemonObject
  function and pokemonSpeciesObject is populated with getPokemonSpeciesObject.
002) When clicking on the image, change to back views. //This has been completed with a
  click event.
003) Get prev button working //Now working properly. Decreases the Pokédex number and
  makes new fetch requests using the generatePreviousPokedexEntry function.
004) Get next button working //Now working properly. Increases the Pokédex number and
  makes new fetch requests using the generateNextPokedexEntry function.
005) Base stats into radar chart. //The chart for stats is generated from the
  displayStatsChart function, convertHexToRgba and getLargestStat are helper functions.
007) Show held items in a list format. //The list of held items is generated from the
  displayHeldItems function.
008) Make abilities and is_hidden into a property of Pokémon. //Abilities is a property,
  but is_hidden does not make sense to make a property at this time.
009) Make generation into a property of pokemon. //The property for generation is
 in the pokemonSpeciesObject generated from the getPokemonSpeciesObject function.
010) Get Pokéball to show in the window tab. //Pokéball is showing in the window tab.
  The pokeball.png file is the one showing.
013) Display Pokédex information in english. //Proper Pokédex entry is being shown using
  the getPokedexEntry function.
014) Change to fetch instead of ajax. //API calls are now using fetch requests instead of
  ajax requests with the fetchPokemon functions.
019) Hover over abilities to get the explanation of what it does. // Created a list
  instead a hover. I believe the API call would be to slow to do this.
020) Uppercase generation and abilities after a hyphen. //The generation is now properly
  upper cased using the formatGeneration function.
021) Rewrite pokemon.css in Sass. //All of the CSS files have been rewritten in Sass and
  have been minified.
023) Merge the pokemonObject and pokemonSpeciesObject into one object. //The objects were
  merged into one object.
024) Try having the Type spans on the same line as the Type Header. //The three elements
  are now on the same plane.
025) Use small Pokéball as bullet points for the different info headers. //Small Pokéballs
  are now bullets for lists.
027) Redo the color scheme. //No longer needed. I have created a very clean and Pokémon
  inspired color scheme.
028) Use arrow functions were available. //The arrow functions are implemented throughout
  the javascript file.
029) Comment and create regions for the entire codebase. //The regions and comments have
  been added to the codebase.
033) Look into DevExpress to see if their chart is better than chart.js. //I am very pleased
  with how chart.js is working currently.
034) Get rid of characters that do not belong (examples: #107 and #369). //Added a method
  called checkTextForUnwantedCharacters to remove these characters.
036) Show abilities in a grid including other information about the ability. // Created a
  list instead a hover. I believe the API call would be to slow to do this.
038) Hover over the base stat number to see the chart. //I have decided to move the stats
  chart to the right side of the screen.
040) Move the chart to its own screen to the left side of the screen. //Moved the stat chart to
  the left side of the screen in its own box.
041) Create web server from MSI gaming PC to host the website. //Decided that I will host this
  website on GitHub.
043) Add media queries for mobile devices. //Media queries have been added for five different
  sizes including mobile devices.
045) Move Pokédex Entry above Base Stats. //Adjusted the order of the displayed information
  in pokedex.html.
046) Add animation for the buttons and the different screens when showing and hiding. //Used
  jQuery's fadeIn, fadeOut, and fadeToggle functions.
048) Capitalize letters after a hyphen. //Added a new function called capitalizeAfterHyphen to
  capitalize the first letter after the hyphen.
049) Fix colorization of the hidden abilities. //The hidden abilities color had an extra #
  making it a green color. Removed the character and it is showing as the correct color.
050) Resize the Held Items List. //The Held Items List is the same size as all of the other
  text items.
051) Experiment with claymorphism and glass textures. //I have decided to go with the neumorphism
  aesthetics for this Pokédex.
052) Use variables in the CSS file. //I have decided to go with using the Sass pre-compiler
  instead of using variables in CSS.
053) Fix the Stats Chart to fit within the screen. //Added a padding setting withing the stats
  chart options.
054) Change font and font size of the Stats Chart. //Added matching font and increased the font
  size of the Stats Chart.
055) Replace IF statements with ternary statements. //The IF statements that could be turned to
  ternary operators have been.
060) Add Height and Weight before the Base Stats. //Added the Height and Weight before the Base
  Stats and added them to the same line.
061) Have a front/back switch to shiny sprites. //Not needed, I decided to show all four sprites
  at one time.
062) Get rid of jQuery. //All jQuery has been removed from the modules and have been replaced
  with vanilla JavaScript.
063) Create different JavaScript modules. //The JavaScript has been separated into different
  modules depending on what the function does.
064) Limit the amount of characters for pokemon-textbox to 3. //The input pokemon-textbox has
  been limited to 3 characters.
065) Create different CSS modules. //The CSS has been separated into different modules depending
  on what elements are being styled.
066) Create a Regular Expression to check the Pokédex number. //Created a function to check against
  a Regular Expression to see if number from the input is valid.
067) Return the Pokédex number to the textbox if the textbox looses focus. //Added a blur event
  listener to recall the Pokémon's ID
069) Create a custom toast or modal when there is an error. //The toast is now in place and is called
  when there is an error.
070) Fix Mr. Mime and Mime Jr.'s names. //The dashes in the names have been fixed on the pokemon.name
  to show periods.
071) Show a Pokéball when a sprite is unavailable. //Now shows a Pokéball when the sprite is null.
  Still looking for better options.
074) Update the Pokémon's ID and name to have it be centered correctly. //The name and ID are now
  centered properly. Padding was added with <li> and had to remove it.
079) Look into storing the last Pokémon viewed before closing the window. //The last ID is now stored
  locally and calls the generatePokemon method.
080) Look into how to monitor if the width has changed. //Using window.onresize, I call
  getSystemInformation() and change elements based on the width.
082) Have gradients instead of a solid border color. //If the Pokémon has multiple types, the border
  will be a gradient instead of a solid color.
085) Switch between forms if the Pokémon has multiple. //Creates a list of forms and allows the user
  to switch between the forms.
099) Capitalize all of the const variables and only import what is needed. //The const variables
  have been capitalized and only the necessary modules have been imported.
101) Fix the Pokémon name in the title to not have text after the hyphens. //The Pokémon name in the
  title now does not have the form name after the hyphens.
